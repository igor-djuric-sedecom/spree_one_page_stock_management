/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * As specified in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem/tree/v4.3.1, this file has to be renamed
 * from .css to .scss, and "asterisk-equal require/require_tree" directives need to be removed or replaced!!
 * See: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem/tree/v4.3.1
